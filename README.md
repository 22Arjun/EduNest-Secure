## 🚀 Overview

**EduNest** is not just another CRUD app; it is a **Fully Vibe Coded** Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 

Built with a focus on **Flow-State Engineering**, it bridges the gap between complex administrative backend logic and a consumer-grade user experience. By prioritizing intuition over convention, EduNest features a **Glassmorphism UI**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, and **Self-Healing Database Transactions** that just *feel* right.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔮 **Fully Vibe Coded**
* **Intuitive Flow:** The codebase was architected with a "Vibe First" philosophy, ensuring that developer intent translates instantly to user delight.
* **Aesthetic Engineering:** Every interaction, from the login fade-in to the dashboard pulse, is crafted to maximize user satisfaction and visual harmony.
* **Modern Velocity:** Built using next-gen AI-assisted workflows to deliver robust features at lightning speed without technical debt.

### 🔐 **Enterprise-Grade Security**
* **Unified Identity Architecture:** Single entry point for both Admins and Students with smart role detection and traffic routing.
* **ACID Compliant Registration:** Uses MongoDB Sessions & Transactions to ensure data integrity. If a student profile fails to create, the user account is automatically rolled back—preventing "Zombie Users."
* **JWT & Bcrypt:** Stateless authentication with hashed passwords and secure cookie management.

### 🎨 **Next-Gen UI/UX**
* **Glassmorphism Design:** A modern, frosted-glass aesthetic using backdrop filters and gradients.
* **Skeleton Loading States:** "Facebook-style" loading animations for a perceived performance boost.
* **Micro-Interactions:** Smooth Framer Motion-style animations for buttons, cards, and page transitions.
